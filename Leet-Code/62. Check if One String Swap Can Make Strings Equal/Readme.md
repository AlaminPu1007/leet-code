Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/

**Problem :**<br>
You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.<br>

Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.<br>
