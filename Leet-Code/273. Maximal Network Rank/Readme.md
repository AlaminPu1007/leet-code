**Complexity Analysis :**<br/>

-   Time-Complexity: `O(E + V^2)` - We iterate on each edge and store both its nodes in the set which will take O(1) time. Thus, for `E` edges, it will take us `O(E)` time. Then we iterate on all possible pairs of the nodes and calculate the network rank which will take `O(1)` time. Thus, `for V(Vâˆ’1)/2` pairs, it will take `O(V^2)`.

-   Space-Complexity: `O(E)` - We use a set that stores all the edge's nodes in it which will take `O(E)` space in a fully connected graph.
