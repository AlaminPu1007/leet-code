[learn solution from here](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/solution/)

**Complexity Approach-1 :**<br>

- Time-Complexity: `O(n * log(n) * m)` // n is loop first while loop and log(n) for finding an item inside hash-map and log(n) for divided and multiply number
- Space-Complexity: `O(n)`

**Complexity Approach-2 :**<br>

- Time-Complexity: `O(n * log(n))` // n is loop first while loop and log(n) for divided and multiply
- Space-Complexity: `O(n)`

**Complexity Approach-3 :**<br>

- Time-Complexity: `O(n * log(n))` // n is loop first while loop and log(n) for divided and multiply
- Space-Complexity: `O(1)`
