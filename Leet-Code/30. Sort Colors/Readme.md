# 75. Sort Colors

Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/

**Problem :**<br>
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color <br>are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.<br>

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.<br>

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.<br>

**Approach :**<br>

We have to solve this problem using sort algorithm, without using any predefined sort library.<br>
There are many sorting algorithm is present, i solved this issue using bubble, and insertion algorithm.<br>

And the last approach is DNF(Dutch National Flag). using this algorithm we get Time-complexity with O(n).<br>
It's an quite interesting algorithm. Lear about it: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s/<br>
