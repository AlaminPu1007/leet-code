**Complexity Approach-1:**<br>
Time Complexity: Exponential in nature, since we are trying out all ways. To be precise it goes as O
`(N! * N)` nearly.<br>
Space Complexity: `O(N^2)`<br>

**Complexity Approach-2:**<br>
Time Complexity: Exponential in nature since we are trying out all ways, to be precise it is `O(N! * N)`.

Space Complexity: `O(N)`
