https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

**Problem :**
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is<br> the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,<br>

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 <br>
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1. <br>
Given n, calculate F(n). <br>

**Approach :**
We need help of recursion.<br>
