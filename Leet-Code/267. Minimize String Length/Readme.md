**Algorithm :**<br/>

-   create an has-map and making key-value pairs using of it.
-   return hash-map size

**Complexity Analysis :**<br/>

-   Time-Complexity: `O(n)` - since we loop through array and making key-value pairs using hash-map. insert item into hash-map in c++, takes `O(1)` times. [Check out this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inserting-elements-in-stdmap-insert-emplace-and-operator/)
-   Space-Complexity: `O(n) - we are using an extra hash-map
