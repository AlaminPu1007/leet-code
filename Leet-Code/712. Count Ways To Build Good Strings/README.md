# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

This problem involved about, given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

**Approach :**<br/>

1. `DFS with Memoization`:

    - Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all possible lengths that can be generated by appending `zero` or `one` characters to the current length.
    - Memoize results for previously computed lengths to avoid redundant calculations.
    - Base Case:
        - If the current length exceeds `high`, stop the recursion (return 0).
        - If the current length is within the range `([low, high])`, increment the result.

2. `Modulo Operation`:
    - Since the results can be large, take modulo `(10^9 + 7)` at every step.

**Complexity Analysis :**<br/>

-   Time-Complexity: `O(n)` - time to fill dp recursively.
-   Space-Complexity: `O(n)` - We build an array `dp` of length `high + 1` which takes `O(n)` space.
