# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/

**Problem :**<br>

- Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the - following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Complexity :**<br>

1. For first approach

- Time-complexity: O(n^2)
- Space-complexity: O(1)

2. For Second approach

- Time-complexity: O(n + m)
- Space-complexity: O(1)

3. For third approach

- Time-complexity: O(log(n) + log(m))
- Space-complexity: O(1)
