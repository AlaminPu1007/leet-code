[Visit Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)

**Approach :**<br>

-   condition1 : we need the size of both strings to be same
-   condition2 : we need freq of char in strings to be same, irrespective of the order

If above 2 conditions are satisfied then just swapping will get us the word2 from word1<br>

**Complexity Analysis :**<br>

-   Time-Complexity: `O(n * log(n))`
-   Space-Complexity: `O(n)`
